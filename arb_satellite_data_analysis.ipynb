        "There are a variety of reasonable ways to address this question.  One way to consider a leak resolved is if an operator confirms and fixes a leak, and then CARB has multiple satellite non-detects above the facility to confirm there is no longer a leak.  Perhaps a similar, but more extensive verification process is required if a facility issues a no-leak-detected event rather than a fixed event.  One could envision the usefulness of CARB administrative event protocols/codes to close open plume tickets.\n",

        "For this analysis, a leak is considered unresolved if its associated ticket has not been closed with a leak-fixed event.  In addition, all of the plumes (both before and after a fixed event) associated with the facilities that had plumes detected after they fixed them are considered unresolved for this analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "This question will be answered in the following steps.\n",
        "1. Use the Ticket Manager to determine how many plumes were detected after an operator indicated that they could find a leak.\n",
        "2. Use the Ticket Manager to determine plumes associated with tickets that are not closed.\n",

This single large plume occurred at one of the four facilities that had satellite plume detection after the operator indicated a leak was fixed.  Given the large size of the plume, the fact that the facility has had 6 satellite total plume detections over the sampling period, and is at a site where plumes have been detected after fixing make it the highest priority for CARB to investigate further.\n",
